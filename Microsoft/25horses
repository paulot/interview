If one can race 5 horses at a time and know only which horse got first, second and third
What is the minimun number of races one can do to find the 3 fastest horses of 25?

9 Races

Do 5 races, each involving 5 horses that have not yet raced:
    Races:
        1 2 3 4 5
        1 2 3 4 5
        1 2 3 4 5
        1 2 3 4 5
        1 2 3 4 5
Now pick the first horse of every race and race them together. Do the same for seconds and thirds.
Note that we can eliminate some horses:

        1 2 3 x x
        1 2 x x x
        1 x x x x
        x x x x x
        x x x x x

We can now race the five remaining horses and find the fastest 3
